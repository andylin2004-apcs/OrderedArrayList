# OrderedArrayList

Design own (private?) method for sorting
Nulllist: compare two, depending on outcome, add or sort
Jason: maybe swap instead of above statement (continuous swap)

smallest out of four, swap it with second one
set first one aside, then swap with second if its smaller, (loops)
